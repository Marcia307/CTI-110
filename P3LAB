# This program allows the user to enter a money (float) value with two places after the decimal.



# Calculate coins needed for change

# Floor division // Gives you back the whole number from division

# Modules % gives you back the remainder from division

# Get amount of money
amount = float(input("Enter the amount of money as a float: "))
print(amount)

#Convert value to integer. Remember the last two digits are still change.
int_amout = int(amount*100)
print(int_amount)
